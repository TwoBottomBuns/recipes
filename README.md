## Easy Access

Click `Actions` at the top, select the latest job, and download the `recipes` artifact at the bottom. Unfortunately,
GitHub does not support uploading a single file as an artifact, so you'll have to unzip it after it's downloaded.

## To build
Run `python3 build.py`. You may need to install a LaTeX compiler.

## Think I should make something?
Create an issue and I'll see about it :sunglasses:
