\section{Spaghetti alla Carbonara}

\begin{itemize}
\item 1 lb guanciale, pancetta, or bacon
\item 1 lb spaghetti
\item 3 large eggs
\item 10 tbsps grated Pecorino Romano cheese, divided
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Cook the meat, turning occasionally until evenly browned. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.
\item Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti until it's just undercooked. Drain and return to
    the pot, stirring occasionally so it doesn't stick.
\item In a bowl, add the following and whisk until smooth and creamy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2 full eggs
    \item 1 egg yolk
    \item 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano
    \item Black pepper
\end{itemize}
\item Pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring quickly so the eggs don't try to set.
\item Add the cooked meat and stir to combine.
\item Serve, adding more Pecorino Romano as desired.
\end{enumerate}
