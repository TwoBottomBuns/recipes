\section{Roasted Tomato Basil Soup}
\label{loc:tomato_soup}

\begin{itemize}
\item 2 lbs tomatoes (roma, plum, or San Marzano)
\item 1 red bell pepper
\item 1 medium yellow onion
\item 6 cloves garlic
\item 1 tsp dried oregano
\item 1 tsp dried thyme
\item 1 tsp tomato paste
\item 2 cups vegetable stock
\item 0.5 cups fresh basil leaves
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Preheat the oven to 425. Trim the stems and cores from the tomatoes and roughly chop. Remove the seeds and ribs
    from the pepper and slice. Peel and quarter the onion. Smash and peel the garlic cloves. Add everything to a baking
    sheet and drizzle with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
\item Roast for 30 minutes, until the vegetables are browned on the edges and fragrant. Transfer them to a slow cooker and
    add the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item oregano
    \item thyme
    \item tomato paste
    \item vegetable stock
\end{itemize}
\item Cover and cook on high for 2 hours.
\item Puree the soup with a blender until creamy.
\item Stack and roll the basil leaves, then thinly slice. Add some to the soup and stir.
\item Serve in bowls, using additional basil as a garnish.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Note}

If you are planning to make this, plan to use the leftovers for the \hyperref[loc:unstuffed_pepper]{Unstuffed Pepper Skillet}!
Just substitute the tomato soup in that recipe with this one!
