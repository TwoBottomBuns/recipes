\section{Unstuffed Pepper Skillet}
\label{loc:unstuffed_pepper}

\begin{itemize}
\item 1 lb Italian style sausage, casing removed (or just buy it ground)
\item 2 large assorted bell peppers, cut into 1.5 inch pieces
\item 1 extra large onion, diced
\item 1 can (10.75 oz) condensed tomato soup (or the leftovers from Unstuffed Pepper Skillet!)
\item 2 cups cooked rice (I usually make too much rice and store the extra separate)
\item 0.5 cups shredded part skim mozzarella cheese
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Cook the sausage in a skillet with oil over medium heat until well browned, stirring often to separate meat.
\item Add the peppers and onion to the skillet and cook until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally.
\item Stir in however much soup and rice you want to get your desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
    Top with cheese, cover, and let stand until the cheese is melted.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Note}

If you are planning to make this, make the \hyperref[loc:tomato_soup]{Roasted Tomato Soup} the night before and use
those leftovers in place of a can of tomato soup!
