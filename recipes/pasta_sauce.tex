\section{Pasta Sauce}

\begin{itemize}
\item 1 red onion, diced
\item 1 carrot, sliced
\item 28 oz can San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes
\item 6 garlic cloves, minced
\item Parmigiano Reggiano
\item fresh basil
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Dump the can of San Marzano tomatoes in a mixing bowl and mash them up with your fingers.
\item Over medium heat, add the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
\item Add onion, carrot, tomatoes (pour over spoon to reduce splatter), basil, olive oil, and salt to the pot.
\item Simmer until the carrots are tender, about 25-30 minutes.
\item Taste and adjust seasoning, then move to a blender to combine everything (or use an immersion blender in the pot).
\item Add pasta to the sauce, along with some of the cooked pasta water. This will help thicken the sauce, as well as
    help it cling to the pasta a little better.
\end{enumerate}
